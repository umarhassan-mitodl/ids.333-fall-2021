## Nature of Quiz

This is an “open-book” quiz. As it would be in professional practice, you can seek out and obtain answers from your notes, texts, the web, friends, etc.

The questions concern the range of concepts, ideas, and associated conclusions we have been exploring in class. You are not required to do any calculations, but you may show some to illustrate your responses.

Your answers must be in your own words, your own terms. Put another way, you should demonstrate your ability to express the answers yourself, to show that you have “internalized” the concepts.

Some, perhaps many of you, will have prepared basic answers in advance. That is OK. Getting you to develop your understanding of the concepts is the object of the course.

As stressed in the Quiz Review, responses phrased in exactly the same way as some other student, or taken directly from a text, will not be given credit. The quiz is to validate your personal understanding, that you can express in your own way.

## Operational Logistics

This is a 90-minute quiz.

This template provides space after each question for your answer. This space is not a limit however. You can use as much as you want.

Note that longer answers are not inherently better! About 10 sentences should do nicely in most cases.
