## LNG Case

The half-semester session closes as it started -- with a case illustrating the use and value of flexibility in design.

The introductory garage case demonstrates the process in a simple case and sets the scene.

The LNG case applies flexibility in design to a complex real design. We begin with a discussion of the South Australian de-salt plant that emphasizes the kind of issues associated with commitment to economies of scale. The LNG case then illustrates the interplay between the deep-seated reflex to focus on economies of scale and the three major counter-pressures for incremental, flexible design:

1. Uncertainties and risk -- The forecast is 'always' wrong and anticipated "requirements" may not be needed
2. Time value of money -- It's economically advantageous to postpone expenses
3. Learning -- We are able to produce cheaper as we produce more.

As such, this LNG discussion epitomizes the overall intent of the course.
